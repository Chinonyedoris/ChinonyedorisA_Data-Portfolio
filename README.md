# üíº Total Sales Computation ‚Äì Excel Project

## üìå Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to compute **Total Sales** in an Excel dataset by applying fundamental Excel functions and relative referencing. It was completed as part of the Quantum Analytics June Cohort ‚Äì Data Analyst Track.

## üéØ Goal
To compute the **Total Sales** for each product entry using the formula: Total Sales = Sales Price √ó Quantity Sold

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies
- Microsoft Excel  
- Relative and Absolute Referencing  
- Excel Formulas: `SUM`, `COUNT`, `COUNTA`, `COUNTBLANK`, `MIN`, `MAX`, `AVERAGE`  
- Paste Special (Values, Formats, Formulas)  
- Transpose Function

## üßÆ Methodology
1. **Dataset Columns**:  
   - Product Name  
   - State  
   - Sales Price  
   - Quantity Sold  

2. **Data Operations**:  
   - Used **relative referencing** to multiply `Sales Price` and `Quantity Sold` to compute `Total Sales`.  
   - Applied the formula in the Total Sales column and used drag-fill to apply it to the rest of the rows.  
   - Used `SUM` to calculate total revenue across all entries.  
   - Used `MIN` and `MAX` to determine the range of values for unit price and total sales.  
   - Applied `COUNT`, `COUNTA`, `COUNTBLANK` to determine data structure and completeness.

3. **Formatting & Cleaning**:  
   - Applied **Paste Special** to isolate formulas, values, and formats.  
   - Used **Transpose** to restructure data as needed.

## üìà Key Outputs
- ‚úÖ Computed total sales for each row
- ‚úÖ Aggregated revenue and sales statistics
- ‚úÖ Identified min/max pricing and volume insights
- ‚úÖ Cleaned and formatted dataset for readability

## üìö Skills Demonstrated
- Spreadsheet computation and logic building  
- Data cleaning and structuring  
- Analytical thinking using Excel tools  
- Understanding of referencing and automation in formulas

# üìà Excel Data Analysis: Sales Report Using Basic Functions

 ## üéØ Objective:

- To analyze a dataset containing Unit Price and Sales Price for different products (Product A and B) using Excel‚Äôs      basic statistical and referencing functions. The goal was to compute:

- Total & Average Unit and Sales Prices

- Count of Columns & Rows

- Maximum Unit Price

- Minimum Sales Price for Products A and B

# üß∞ Excel Functions Used:

## Function	Purpose

=SUM(range)	Calculated total unit prices and total sales prices
=AVERAGE(range)	Found the average unit price and average sales price
=COUNT(range)	Counted all numeric (filled) entries in a column
=COUNTA(range)	Counted all non-blank cells, including text
=COUNTBLANK(range)	Identified blank/missing data for cleaning
=COLUMNS(range)	Determined number of variables/fields
=ROWS(range)	Counted total records/data entries
=MAX(range)	Found the highest unit price
=MIN(range)	Found the lowest sales price of each product

# üß™ Problem Solved:

## Using these formulas:

‚úÖ Total Unit Price ‚Üí =SUM(Unit_Price_Column)

‚úÖ Total Sales Price ‚Üí =SUM(Sales_Price_Column)

‚úÖ Average Unit Price ‚Üí =AVERAGE(Unit_Price_Column)

‚úÖ Average Sales Price ‚Üí =AVERAGE(Sales_Price_Column)

‚úÖ Number of Columns ‚Üí =COLUMNS(Table_Range)

‚úÖ Number of Rows ‚Üí =ROWS(Table_Range)

‚úÖ Maximum Unit Price ‚Üí =MAX(Unit_Price_Column)

‚úÖ Minimum Sales Price (Product A & B) ‚Üí

## For Product A: =MIN(IF(Product_Column="A", Sales_Price_Column))

## For Product B: =MIN(IF(Product_Column="B", Sales_Price_Column)) (as an array formula or with FILTER function in Excel 365)

## üîç Insights Gained:

Identified pricing patterns across products

Detected missing values using COUNTBLANK

Practiced conditional logic (filtering by product)

Strengthened understanding of Excel's statistical tools for Business Analytics.

# üìä Excel Data Analysis: Revenue Insights using Basic Functions
## Exploratory Revenue Data Analysis using Excel ‚Äì Quantum Analytics 

Using absolute referencing, I successfully computed Net Salary for various employee IDs based on constant deductions across rows.

## üß† Key Excel Functions & Outcomes:

Task: Excel Function Used	Purpose	Outcome

Identify total columns (variables)	=COLUMNS(range)	Know number of features/data points	Returned the count of columns
Count total data entries	=ROWS(range)	Understand dataset size	Returned the number of rows
Find minimum revenue	=MIN(range)	Identify lowest revenue	Displayed lowest revenue value
Find maximum revenue	=MAX(range)	Identify peak revenue	Displayed highest revenue value
Calculate total revenue	=SUM(range)	Add up total income	Returned the full sum of revenue
Count revenue entries	=COUNT(range)	Count valid revenue data cells	Counted all filled numeric cells
Determine average revenue	=AVERAGE(range)	Compute mean revenue	Showed overall average revenue

# ‚úÖ Excel Conditional Statements ‚Äì Practical Application  | Quantum Analytics
  
  I worked on a project that focused on applying conditional logic using Excel‚Äôs built-in functions.

üîß Tasks Completed:

Used IF, AND, and OR functions to categorize data based on multiple conditions.

Applied nested IF statements to classify employees based on salary thresholds (e.g., "High", "Medium", or "Low").

Created automated decision rules to flag employees eligible for bonuses based on performance scores and tenure.

Used Conditional Formatting in combination with formulas to visually highlight rows meeting specific criteria (e.g., underperformers or top earners).

Ensured data accuracy by validating the logic with sample datasets.


üìä Key Outcome: Transformed raw data into structured, insight-driven outputs that allowed quick decision-making. These exercises deepened my understanding of how logical functions drive data filtering, analysis, and reporting in business environments.

   When and why the Nigerian economy grew significantly

   What investments or policies contributed to such growth

   What caused declines, stagnation, or economic slowdowns

   How these trends inform scalable growth opportunities for Nigeria‚Äôs future

   This project is a blend of research, business intelligence, and economic storytelling, grounded in data. I‚Äôll be using:

   Power BI dashboards for dynamic visualization

   Time-series and regression analysis for modeling trends

   Correlation and inferential tools to tie macroeconomic events to outcomes

# Invitation to Join the Journey
    I invite you to join me on this exciting research and business intelligence journey into Nigeria‚Äôs GDP. Whether you are a data            analyst, economist, policymaker, or simply curious about Nigeria‚Äôs economic development‚Äîthis project is for you.

    Stay tuned as we uncover hidden insights, spot economic patterns, and bring data to life in the Nigerian context.

## üöÄ CloudSec Network Bootcamp ‚Äì AWS Identity Center Setup ‚úÖ

Excited to share another milestone in my AWS Cloud Computing journey!

As part of Week 2 of the CloudSec Network Bootcamp, I successfully configured AWS IAM Identity Center (formerly AWS SSO):

üîπ Set up a new user account
üîπ Assigned permission sets using SecurityAudit policies
üîπ Tested and submitted all deliverables via screenshot validation

This hands-on task deepened my understanding of:
üîê Identity and access management (IAM)
üõ°Ô∏è Security policies and permission sets
‚öôÔ∏è Administrative cloud configurations

# Amazon AMI EC2 Instance Deployment: Launched a Windows Server EC2 instance using Amazon‚Äôs AMI on a public subnet.

     Security Configuration: Created a Security Group allowing RDP (port 3389) access only from my public IP, minimizing      exposure to unauthorized access.
     
    ‚úÖAs part of the CSN CloudSec Bootcamp Week 3 task, I successfully launched and configured a Windows Server 2025 EC2       instance on Amazon Web Services (AWS). The objective was to provision a secure, publicly accessible virtual server       instance and ensure controlled RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) access.

## ‚úÖ AWS Bootcamp ‚Äì Week 4: VPC & Subnet Configuration Achieved!

Excited to announce I successfully completed Week 4 of the CloudSec Network AWS Bootcamp, where I worked on simulating a multi-VPC architecture üéØ

üöÄ Key Milestones:
üîπ Created two separate VPCs (VPC-A: 10.10.0.0/16 & VPC-B: 10.20.0.0/16)
üîπ Configured public & private subnets in both VPCs
üîπ Established VPC Peering between the two environments
üîπ Updated route tables to enable traffic flow
üîπ Captured console screenshots for validation and documentation

This hands-on experience strengthened my grasp of AWS Networking, Subnetting, and Cloud Infrastructure security. I'm one step closer to mastering AWS architecture! üåêüî•
